# R2PG-DM

This is an application for constructing property graphs from relational databases. 

## Setup config.ini
In order to use the application, a config.ini file is necessary for specifying the input databases connections. The format is the following:

```
[input]
connectionString=
driver=sqlite
```

Where the *connectionString* represents the jdbc connection string format as defined here: https://vladmihalcea.com/jdbc-driver-connection-url-strings/

The application has been tested with sqlite and will likely need some implementation changes with respect to handling spaces in order to be used with other SQL database systems. Alternatively, you can use the forked repository instead (But it is very slow for anything but toy databases).

## Neo4j

The application will generate the graph into 3 CSV files in the root folder called: **nodes.csv**, **edges.csv** and **properties.csv**. You can use these files as input for a Neo4j instance by running the script presented in file **script.cypher** located in this repository. 

For more information on how to install and setup a Neo4j instance refer to this website: https://neo4j.com/download/
For more information on where to copy/paste the csv files, please see Section 2 in the following tutorial: https://neo4j.com/developer/desktop-csv-import/ (ignore the cypher (LOAD) queries in this article and use the queries from script.cypher instead.)

Use Neo4j instance for visualization. Need plugin APOC installed (dynamic labels) -> https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/
